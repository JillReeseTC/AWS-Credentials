No one wants to accidentally ship AWS credentials and keys to GitHub
This set of methods gets the credentials from the home computer at runtime
avoiding the need to place anything in the code itself.

REQUIRED:  Obtain an AWS key and secret key. Place them in the .NET
           SDK Store on your computer which stores them encrypted in a standard
           place for Visual Studio Community and Visual Studio Code to find and use.
           The following program will place them in the SDK Store which is located at:
           %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\AWSToolkit\RegisteredAccounts.json

1. Use NuGet to add the following packages to the project:
     AWSSDK.Core
              
2. Add "using Amazon;" and "using Amazon.Runtime.CredentialManagement;"
   to your libraries at the top of the code.
   
3. From Program.cs, run the following two lines with your profile name
   and key, then with your profile name and region:
       
    WriteProfile("my_new_profile", "AWS-ACCESS-KEY-VALUE", "AWS-SECRET-KEY-VALUE");
    AddRegion("my_new_profile", RegionEndpoint.USEast1);
        
4. Once the SDK Store is written, REMOVE THOSE KEYS FROM YOUR CODE.
